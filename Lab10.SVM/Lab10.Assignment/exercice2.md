### Exercise 2 Questions(4 points)

1. Can SVM be used for unsupervised clustering or data dimension reduction? Why?

    `No. SVM need at least some of the data to be labeled. Hence is supervised.`

2. What are the strengths of SVMs; when do they perform well?

    `It is suitable for both large and small size of data and features. It is away from the probabilities and statics. It depends on small number of features, and is hence robust.`

    `It performs well on small datasets and complex decision boarders.`

3. What are the weaknesses of SVMs; when do they perform poorly?

    `It's efficiency declines vastly on large datasets. It depends largely on preprocessing and data quality. It is relatively hard to explain.`

4. What makes SVMs a good candidate for the classification / regression problem, if you have enough knowledge about the data?

    `If the dataset size is not very large and the data has many complex features, it is a good choice to apply SVMs to it.`
